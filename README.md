Docker

Docker is a platform that enables you to package applications into portable,
self-contained containers that can run anywhere, simplifying deployment and reducing dependency issues.
Containers include everything needed for the application, such as libraries and configurations,
and are lightweight and fast. 

Docker allows for easy scaling and management of applications using tools
like Docker Compose. In this project, you'll set up an infrastructure with a reverse proxy, a load balancer,
two application servers, and a front-end server.
